# Vancouver Sports Analytics Symposium and Hackathon First Place Winner for the Canucks Category

   Hackathon date: July 8-9 2017 
   hackathon website: https://www.vansash.com/

For this hackathon my group and I had 24 hours to analyze Canucks powerplay data, 
a massive spreadsheet with player location, player name and an ambiguous time-stamp 
with no indications of passes, shots, goals, or hits. We knew during a powerplay the 
defensive team has the option of clearing the puck without receiving an icing penalty 
and so we decided to calculate when the puck moved past the blue line forcing the 
offensive team to regroup due to the offside rule. I coded a MatLab program to track 
the position of the puck, display where a turnover occurs on the ice by which players 
at what time. My teammates used R and Python to devise heatmaps of where turnovers 
occur by which players and where on the ice compared to league averages while also 
conducting statistical analysis. 

The judges liked our graphics, originality and applicability to coaching/management 
and as a result our group of mostly first years with no hackathon experience won first among 100 others!

Although my matlab code requires the canucks spreadsheet data to be imported, I signed
a non disclosure agreement form that does not allow me to publicly post the canucks 
data. However, the power point presentation does showcase all of my teams work. If the 
.gif file does not play in the powerpoint, you may view it as it's included in this 
folder.
